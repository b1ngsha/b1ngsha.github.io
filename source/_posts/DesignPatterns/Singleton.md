**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

<br>

## Problem

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the *Single Responsibility Principle*:

1. **Ensure that a class has just a single instance.**
2. **Provide a global access point to that instance.**

----

## Solution

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

* Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class.
* Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.

If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it's able to call the Singleton's static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.

## Singleton in Java

### Naïve Singleton (single-threaded)

It’s pretty easy to implement a sloppy Singleton. You just need to hide the constructor and implement a static creation method.

**Singleton.java: Singleton**

```java
public final class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    public String value;

    private Singleton(String value) {
        // The following code emulates slow initialization.
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        this.value = value;
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance(String value) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(value);
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**DemoSingleThread.java: Client code**

```java
public class DemoSingleThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("If you see the same value, then singleton was reused (yay!)" + "\n" +
                "If you see different values, then 2 singletons were created (booo!!)" + "\n\n" +
                "RESULT:" + "\n");
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance("FOO");
        Singleton anotherSingleton = Singleton.getInstance("BAR");
        System.out.println(singleton.value);
        System.out.println(anotherSingleton.value);
    }
}
```

**OutputDemoSingleThread.txt: Execution result**

```
If you see the same value, then singleton was reused (yay!)
If you see different values, then 2 singletons were created (booo!!)

RESULT:

FOO
FOO
```

### Naïve Singleton (multithreaded)

The same class behaves incorrectly in a multithreaded environment. Multiple threads can call the creation method simultaneously and get several instances of Singleton class.

**Singleton.java: Singleton**

```java
public final class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    public String value;

    private Singleton(String value) {
        // The following code emulates slow initialization.
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        this.value = value;
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance(String value) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(value);
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**DemoMultiThread.java: Client code**

```java
public class DemoMultiThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("If you see the same value, then singleton was reused (yay!)" + "\n" +
                "If you see different values, then 2 singletons were created (booo!!)" + "\n\n" +
                "RESULT:" + "\n");
        Thread threadFoo = new Thread(new ThreadFoo());
        Thread threadBar = new Thread(new ThreadBar());
        threadFoo.start();
        threadBar.start();
    }

    static class ThreadFoo implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance("FOO");
            System.out.println(singleton.value);
        }
    }

    static class ThreadBar implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance("BAR");
            System.out.println(singleton.value);
        }
    }
}
```

If you see the same value, then singleton was reused (yay!)
If you see different values, then 2 singletons were created (booo!!)

RESULT:

FOO
BAR
```

### Thread-safe Singleton with lazy loading

To fix the problem, you have to synchronize threads during first creation of the Singleton object.

**Singleton.java: Singleton**

```java
public final class Singleton {
    // The field must be declared volatile so that double check lock would work
    // correctly.
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    public String value;

    private Singleton(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance(String value) {
        // The approach taken here is called double-checked locking (DCL). It
        // exists to prevent race condition between multiple threads that may
        // attempt to get singleton instance at the same time, creating separate
        // instances as a result.
        //
        // It may seem that having the `result` variable here is completely
        // pointless. There is, however, a very important caveat when
        // implementing double-checked locking in Java, which is solved by
        // introducing this local variable.
        //
        // You can read more info DCL issues in Java here:
        // https://refactoring.guru/java-dcl-issue
        Singleton result = instance;
        if (result != null) {
            return result;
        }
        synchronized(Singleton.class) {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Singleton(value);
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }
}
```

**DemoMultiThread.java: Client code**

```java
public class DemoMultiThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("If you see the same value, then singleton was reused (yay!)" + "\n" +
                "If you see different values, then 2 singletons were created (booo!!)" + "\n\n" +
                "RESULT:" + "\n");
        Thread threadFoo = new Thread(new ThreadFoo());
        Thread threadBar = new Thread(new ThreadBar());
        threadFoo.start();
        threadBar.start();
    }

    static class ThreadFoo implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance("FOO");
            System.out.println(singleton.value);
        }
    }

    static class ThreadBar implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance("BAR");
            System.out.println(singleton.value);
        }
    }
}
```
